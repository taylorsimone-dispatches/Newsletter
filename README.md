A Vancouver-based film/television tech professional and freelance journalist. 

I dispatch for 19+ departments for major film productions and TV shows shooting in British Columbia. 

Specialties include communications, reporting, privacy, data, and conflict resolution in the motion picture industry.

My debut book If At First You Don’t Succeed is slated for 2022 [*fingers crossed*]

Available in print/ebook potentially on a blockchain domain.
